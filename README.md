# My goals on Github
- Create a private repository for eye-tracking data and all the scripts, from preprocessing to statistical analysis and plot generation
- Create a private repository for PronounHistory data and scripts
- Create a repository for analysing embeddings in Russian (as soon as I really begin with it)

# Further ideas
I can also use Github for teaching, but I'm not sure how yet. 

## A note
la command didn't work for me so I used ls -la.
